# ReactJS Basics

This repository contains a simple project on reactjs which creates a header and renders from different components.

# Details

1) "class App extends React.Component {" created our first component
2) render() this function is called by react whenever it has to render a component
3) We created multiple components through Header, Home and App. 
4) We can check changes in Rendering tab on Developers tool and Enable pain flashing, which will highlight the changes being done by Virtual DOM. Hence React is very fast.
